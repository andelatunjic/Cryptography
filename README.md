## Cryptography
*November, 2022.*

The purpose of this solution is to:
* create and store cryptographic keys in secret_key.txt, public_key.txt and private_key.txt files,
* do encryption, and decryption of a given file by symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) algorithms,
* calculate message summary of a input file (SHA256), and
* digitally sign the input file and verify the digital signature (RSA and SHA256).
